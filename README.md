# buzzctl

Use the timeBuzzer® hardware without the vendor software: documented MIDI
protocol, a debug tool, and `buzzerd` — a macOS daemon that maps the wheel
and button to keyboard shortcuts and shell commands, with per-app profiles
and LED feedback.

## Buzzctl.app (menu bar app)

Native menu bar app that bundles the daemon with a UI: connection status,
pause toggle, launch-at-login, and a graphical profile editor (with an app
picker, action fields, and an LED color picker).

1. Download the latest `Buzzctl-*.zip` from
   [Releases](https://github.com/a-und-b/buzzctl/releases), unzip, and move
   `Buzzctl.app` to `/Applications`.
2. The app is ad-hoc signed (no Apple Developer ID). On first launch macOS
   will refuse it once — allow it via System Settings → Privacy & Security →
   "Open Anyway", or clear the quarantine flag:

   ```bash
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Buzzctl.app
   ```

The app's config lives at `~/Library/Application Support/Buzzctl/buzzerd.json`
— edit it in the UI or as JSON (hot-reloaded either way). Building from
source instead: `./build.sh` produces both `Buzzctl.app` and the CLI.

## buzzerd (CLI)

```bash
./build.sh
./buzzerd buzzerd.json
```

- **Hot-plug:** unplugging/replugging the buzzer is detected.
- **Hot-reload:** config changes are picked up at runtime (mtime poll, ~2 s).
- **Verbose mode:** `./buzzerd -v buzzerd.json` logs every raw MIDI event.
- **Autostart:** edit the two `/PATH/TO` entries in `buzzerd.plist`, then
  `cp buzzerd.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ && launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/buzzerd.plist`.
- **Self-check:** `./buzzerd selftest`

Planned features: see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

### Configuration

`buzzerd.json` is a JSON object mapping **app bundle IDs to profiles**. The
profile of the frontmost app is active; `default` is the fallback for every
app not listed:

```json
{
  "default": {
    "led": [0, 40, 127],
    "press":     { "key": "mute" },
    "wheelUp":   { "key": "volumeup" },
    "wheelDown": { "key": "volumedown" }
  },
  "com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX": {
    "led": [0, 127, 127],
    "press":     { "key": "space" },
    "wheelUp":   { "key": "right" },
    "wheelDown": { "key": "left" }
  },
  "com.microsoft.teams2": {
    "led": [127, 0, 0],
    "press": { "key": "cmd+shift+m" }
  }
}
```

To find an app's bundle ID:

```bash
osascript -e 'id of app "QuickTime Player"'
```

#### Events

Every profile entry maps events to actions. All events are optional:

| Event | Fires when |
|-------|-----------|
| `press` / `release` | the buzzer is pressed down / let go |
| `wheelUp` / `wheelDown` | the wheel is turned (once per step) |
| `touch` / `untouch` | a hand rests on the buzzer / is lifted, without pressing |

#### Actions

An action is an object with exactly one of two keys:

- **`{"shell": "…"}`** — run a shell command (`/bin/sh -c`). Works without
  any permissions. This covers almost everything: `osascript`, `open`, and
  `shortcuts run "Name"` to trigger automations built in the macOS
  Shortcuts app.
- **`{"key": "…"}`** — synthesize a key press. Requires a one-time
  Accessibility grant (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility);
  buzzerd prompts for it at startup if key actions are configured.
  Two forms:
  - **Shortcut combos** like `cmd+shift+m` — modifiers `cmd`, `shift`,
    `alt`/`opt`, `ctrl`, plus one key: a letter, digit, `space`, `return`,
    `tab`, `delete`, `esc`, `f1`–`f12`, or arrow keys
    `left`/`right`/`up`/`down`. Key codes are US-physical; on QWERTZ
    layouts z/y are swapped (see ROADMAP).
  - **Named media keys** `volumeup`, `volumedown`, `mute`, `playpause`,
    `next`, `previous` — sent as native system events, so the macOS
    volume/playback HUD appears and playback controls reach whatever app
    is currently playing.

#### LED

`"led"` sets the buzzer's LED color while the profile is active — glanceable
feedback for which mode you're in. Values are 0–127 per channel:

- `[r, g, b]` — all three LEDs the same color
- `[r, g, b, r, g, b, r, g, b]` — left, middle, right LED individually

## Protocol

The device is **not HID** — it is a standard **USB MIDI device**
(USB `16D0:1170`, audio class with a MIDI streaming interface). macOS binds
it to the MIDIServer automatically; it shows up as a MIDI source **and**
destination named "timeBuzzer". No driver required.

Everything is Control Change on MIDI channel 12 (status byte `0xBB`):

| CC | Direction | Meaning |
|----|-----------|---------|
| 70–72 | → device | Left LED: R, G, B (0–127) |
| 73–75 | → device | Middle LED: R, G, B |
| 76–78 | → device | Right LED: R, G, B |
| 80 | ← device | Wheel, absolute position 0–127 (wraps) |
| 81 | ← device | Touch sensor, active-low: < 64 = touched; state is repeated every ~1.5 s (looks like a heartbeat) |
| 82 | ← device | Button: 127 = pressed, 0 = released |

The device does not respond to the standard SysEx identity request
(`F0 7E 7F 06 01 F7`).

## Tools

```
swift buzzer.swift listen                    # dump incoming events (hex + decoded)
swift buzzer.swift led 127 0 0               # all 3 LEDs red
swift buzzer.swift led 127 0 0 0 127 0 0 0 127   # left red, middle green, right blue
swift buzzer.swift send BB 46 7F             # send raw MIDI bytes
swift buzzer.swift scan [from] [to] [ms]     # step through CCs one by one
```

`led-ui.html` — browser UI (Web MIDI, open in Chrome) with buttons for the
LED CCs.

Since this is a standard MIDI device, any MIDI library works out of the box:
Python (`mido`), Node (`easymidi`), the browser (Web MIDI API) — no driver
needed.
